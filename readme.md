As you can probably tell very soon when you read the code, a lot of it is AI generated.
Of course, the AI didn't chose the programming language, and I'm not blindly following the AI
without having a good understanding of it.

I used AI for this project, and infact, this is the only project that the AI did most of the work for me!
I used AI because, I was initially a THREE.js beginner! But now, since I wrote some code myself, I had to
read through the AI's code too because... Well, then how do I know what to write?
I, if I can will try to show my chat with the AI!

WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE AI:
 -How three js works (some of it, the rest on youtube)
 -How the chunking system work
 -How to use the performance tab in developer tools
 -How workers work

WHAT THE AI HELPED WITH (all the parts with a lot of comments):
 -Most of overwold.html file
 -Some of chunkWorker.js
 -All the functions other than tick() and collisionTick()

AIs USED:
 -DeepSeek V3
 -DeepSeek R1
 -ChatGPT o3 mini
 -Gemini 2.5 Pro (THE BEST ONE, AND THE ONE I USED MOST! Really recommend it.)
 -And I can't forget this one, the one the is a similar version of Github Copilot: Windsurf (formerly Codeium)
